This repository contains the source code and dissertation relating to my MSc project on 
ensemble machine learning for Twitter sentiment classification.
Besides implementing existing machine learning algorithms I developed novel ensemble algorithms "Hybrid Boost",
and "Bayesian Hybrid Boost" inspired by AdaBoost and Bayesian Model Averaging.
Implemention in R can be found in the "ensembles" folder while a conceptual describtion can be found
in chapter 8 of the accompanying "Ensemble_Sentiment_Classification.pdf" file.
The code is in a format that was convenient for research purposes but is not suitable for integration into a system.
For my next project I am planning to create a sentiment classification software for which I will either transform
the R-code into a more production friendly format or re-implement the project in Python.
